Description: LassoBag provided a implementation of a CART frame for
    selecting markers from multiple models. The main application of this
    package is to screen limited number of variables that are less
    dependent to train dataset. Basically, this packages was initially
    deveploped for adjust LASSO selected results from bootstrap sample
    sets. Variables with the highest frequency among the several selected
    result were considered as stable variables for dataset. However, it
    usually hard to determine the cutoff frequency when applied in real
    dataset. In this package, we intrudoced an imputation strategy to get
    P value of each variables. We also performed multiple correction for
    each P value.
